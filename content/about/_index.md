## Programmer

First and formost I have been a coder for the last 25 years. I have programmed in many
languages, environments, and domains. Here is a list of languages / platforms / 
frameworks, I have spent most of my time with ...

[Here](/about/resume) is my resume

### Python

This was one of the first languages I learnt. From web development, scientific 
programming, data science and much more. Most of my personal utility/automation
are written in python. Python has been my go to language for over 25 years. Yes,
I remember the python 1 days.

A more detailed list of my python experience is [here](/about/python/)


### Java Script

I have been also doing JS for a long time now. Started with JQuery and DOJO, then moved
to Backbone.js then to angular.js. Now I primarily code in React and Angular.io with
exposure to Vue.js.

I have also worked with Node.js for backend development. Mostly with express.js and
fastify.js.

### Java (JVM)

Most of my paid work was on the Java platform in the late 2000s to the early 2010s.
I remember the drudgery by it did pay well. I gave up on the Java language almost a
decade ago in favour of scala.

### Scala

As the ecosystem of other JVM languages emerged, Scala is now my default for working on
the JVM. I keep an active eye on Clojure which is elegant, and Kotlin mainly for
android work.

### Ruby

15 years ago, I worked on a major Ruby on Rails project. And after that every few
years or so, a Rails project would come my way. From rails experience has ranged from
the early days of rails 1.0 to rails 5.0. 

### Golang

Recently a lot of my projects have been in Golang. They have all been
HTTP REST API projects. Though I am exploring writing a few CLI tools in Golang.

### Ancient Stuff

I have also programmed in C, C++, Fortran in my university days mostly writing
high performance scientific code.

Very early in my career I did a lot of PHP, Wordpress themes, Joomla/Drupal extensions,
and such.
