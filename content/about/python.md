## My python experience

### Web development

Web development is how I payed my bills, I started out in ancient times with zope, 
and jumped to better and better frameworks. From zope, I jumped to pylons and then to
django and then to flask. Currently I'm heavily inclined towards fastAPI and it's 
ecosystem.

### Data science

### Personal Utility

I belive in "Automate the boring stuff" philosophy. This for me takes the form of
may python scripts / utilites.
